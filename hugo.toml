I’m a DevOps and Infrastructure Engineer from Kathmandu, Nepal, passionate about building reliable, scalable systems. I work mainly with Google Cloud and Kubernetes, focusing on automation and performance at scale. 

I love puzzles whether in infrastructure, on a tough hike, or during a long run. I enjoy hard problems, physical challenges, and working with smart people to solve them.
